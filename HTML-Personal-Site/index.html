    <h1>Evan Barton</h1>
    <p><em>Software engineer</em></p>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer skilled in Node.js and React.js. I began learning
      software engineering in 2020 after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I
      attended the nine month coding bootcamp, Lambda School (now known as Bloom
      Institute of Technology), and also began studying at American Public
      University, where I studied Programming. While my degree was focused on
      Java, we also touched on, among other things, web development, which I
      found to be more my liking. Outside of development, I am a drummer,
      guitarist, and enjoy the MOBA game "League of Legends".
